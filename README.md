# Pi-Quick-Tools
  This is an application coded in python designed for the Raspberry Pi. It includes a few quick features, like cleaning the apt in one click, upgrading it in one click, showing the CPU temperature, also showing rpi config, etc etc.

Make sure that the folder is called 'Pi-Quick-Tools' and also in the /home/pi folder, or it won't work properly.

Do note that this is in development and not everything will work.

If you have any suggestions please say in that issues channel. Thank you very much in advance.
